# **Heart Disease Prediction - End-to-End Project**

This project is an end-to-end Machine Learning application that predicts the likelihood of heart disease based on user inputs. It includes modular code, a Flask-based web application, and is containerized using Docker for easy deployment.


## Features

- **Machine Learning**: Predicts heart disease using a trained ML model.
- **Web Interface**: User-friendly UI built with Flask.
- **Modular Codebase**: Code is organized into reusable modules.
- **Containerization**: Fully containerized using Docker for easy deployment.

## Requirements
To run this project, ensure the following are installed:

- Python 3.9 or above
- Docker
- pip (Python package installer)
## Setup Instructions
Clone the Repository

```bash
https://github.com/anonymous298/End-To-End-Ml-Heart-Disease.git
cd End-To-End-Ml-Heart-Disease
```


## Run Locally without Docker

1. Create a Virtual Environment:

```bash
conda create -p venv python==3.9
```

2. Install Dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
3. Run the Application:

```bash
python app.py
```

4. Open the app in your browser:

```bash
http://127.0.0.1:8080
```

## Run Using Docker

1. Build the Docker Image:

```bash
docker build -t heart-disease-model .
```

2. Run the Docker Container:

```bash
docker run -d -p 8080:8080 heart-disease-model
```

4. Open the app in your browser:

```bash
http://localhost:8080
```

## Pull and Run Prebuilt Docker Image

Use the prebuild image:

1. Pull the Docker Image:

```bash
docker pull talha213/heart-disease-model
```

2. Run the Docker Container:

```bash
docker run -d -p 8080:8080 heart-disease-model
```

## Using the Application
1. Open the web application in your browser:
```bash
http://localhost:8080
```
2. On the homepage, click "Get Started" to navigate to the form.
3. Fill in the details like age, sex, chest pain type, etc.
4. Submit the form to get the prediction result.

## Project Highlights

- Built using a modular coding approach for  scalability.
- Provides an interactive web interface for predictions.
- Easily deployable using Docker.
